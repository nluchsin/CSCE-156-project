# CSCE-156-project

These files was my team project for my CSCE 156 project at UNL in Spring 2017. It was designed to pull financial data such as savings accounts and stocks from a SQL database and then interpret and output the data through the command line. It has been tested on the CSCE OpenSuse and MySQL servers with the Java section of the project working on the Java Eclipe IDE.
